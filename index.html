                "My family trip started off in Madrid, Spain. 
                After picking up my sister, who was studying abroad in Madrid, we began sightseeing. 
                One of the best part of the trips was getting to tour the Santiago Bernabeu, which is Real Madrid's CF stadium. 
                Being a soccer player and a soccer fan for most of my life, it was an amazing feeling to learn 
                about the history of the club and to see all the trophies they have won.
                "

            <h2>Barcelona, Spain</h2>
            <p>
                "After driving from Madrid to Barcelona, we noticed there are some beautiful cathadrals .
                One that is still under construction called Sagrada Familia. It's been under construction for over 150 years.
                It's said to be finished in 2026."
